# Peaksel SDK

This library provides a universal API to work with chromatography data using [Peaksel](https://elsci.io/peaksel). You could use it to:

* Parse raw data via Peaksel. Then fetch the traces and spectra to implement some custom algorithms for processing of Mass Spectrometry or Chromatography data.
* Mine chromatography data across organization
* Automate the upload of raw data from the HPLC instruments to Peaksel (on-prem and private SaaS have this built-in)
* Integrate your ELN (or other in-house systems) with HPLC database to automatically submit and fetch chromatography data

Available in languages:

* [Python](./python)
